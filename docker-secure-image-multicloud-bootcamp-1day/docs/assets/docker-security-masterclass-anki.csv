What tool generates SBOMs?,Syft (Anchore).
What tool scans vulnerabilities?,Trivy (Aqua Security).
Which benchmark defines Docker hardening best practices?,CIS Docker Benchmark.
What is no-new-privileges flag?,Prevents processes from gaining more privileges than their parent.
How can you drop all Linux capabilities in Docker?,Use --cap-drop=ALL flag at runtime.
What is SLSA?,Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts – framework for build provenance.
Why use IAM least privilege?,To reduce impact if credentials are compromised.
What is an SBOM?,Software Bill of Materials listing packages and dependencies in an image.
What is an admission controller?,Kubernetes component that intercepts API requests before persistence to etcd.
What is Workload Identity Federation (GCP)?,Allows workloads to assume GCP IAM roles without long-lived keys.
What are managed identities (Azure)?,Azure AD identities assigned to resources for secure access to other services.
What is IRSA in AWS?,IAM Roles for Service Accounts – map K8s service accounts to IAM roles.
How to check image size in Docker?,docker images command lists sizes.
Why prefer multi-stage builds?,Reduce final image size and remove build-time dependencies.
What is AppArmor?,Linux kernel security module for mandatory access control profiles.
What is Seccomp?,Linux syscall filter defining allowed system calls for a container.
What does Falco detect?,Syscall-level anomalies like spawning a shell or accessing /etc/shadow.
Which flag prevents privileged containers?,--privileged should never be used; omit it.
What is Docker Content Trust?,Feature enabling signed images using Notary to verify publisher identity.

Purpose of runtime threat detection?,Detect compromise attempts and policy violations at runtime.
Why is rootless better?,Prevents container breakout from root-level privileges.
When to use Alpine over Distroless?,When debugging or small size is needed but minimal base remains acceptable.
Why scan images regularly?,To catch newly disclosed CVEs even after build time.
Why sign images?,To ensure authenticity and integrity of container builds.
How does Kyverno enforce policy?,By acting as Kubernetes admission controller validating API requests.
