## ✅ Module 5: Secrets Management - SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED!

### Implementation Status:
- [x] Docker Compose with volume-mounted secrets
- [x] Application that reads secrets from files
- [x] Secrets properly masked in all outputs
- [x] All endpoints tested and working
- [x] Security headers and best practices implemented
- [x] Permission issues resolved

### Key Learnings:
- **Volume mounts** are more reliable than Docker secrets for development
- **File permissions** are critical (644 for files, 755 for directories)
- **Always mask secrets** in logs and API responses
- **Read-only mounts** enhance security

### Working Endpoints:
- ✅ `GET /` - Application information
- ✅ `GET /secrets-info` - Masked secrets display
- ✅ `GET /health` - Health monitoring

## 🚀 Module 6: Multi-Cloud Security

### Ready to Learn:
- Cloud-specific Docker security considerations
- Multi-cloud deployment strategies
- Cloud security services integration
- Cross-cloud security patterns
